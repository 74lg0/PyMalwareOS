# PyMalwareOS
## [1] SSH-Remote-Access
A simple malware created with Python, designed for remote access via SSH
By reading the ".authorized.txt" file and writing the data to the "authorized_keys" of SSH
To send a request to an established host where the console user's username
And their corresponding IP address are displayed
The host can be easily edited from the source code and the ".authorized.txt" file as well. 
NOTE FOR BEGINNERS => You should copy the Public RSA key from your machine, usually located in the .ssh directory in the home/

## [2] Simple-Ransomware DarkCrypt
A simple ransomware using the Cryptography library and the implementation of an asymmetric key with Fernet to encrypt all directories and files in the User directory. 
This malware is specifically designed for Windows and possibly in the future for Linux as well.
Its sole function is file encryption; it does not provide a Command and Control console or Remote Access, nor does it send requests to a host. 
The simple ransomware operates completely independently of the need for the internet. In the future, a form of remote access through SSH or another persistence method may be added to the Linux version.
